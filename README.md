# G4STAB

A multi-input deep learning model to predict G-quadruplex thermodynamic stability based on sequence and salt concentration.

Trained models are stored in the `trained_models` folder. All models use identical architectures and hyperparameters, trained on the same dataset but with different random shuffles of the training data
